-   Support a ``"firefox"`` directive that will configure a user's Firefox profile(s).
-   Support a ``"user.js"`` configuration key.

    The plugin will search all known system-specific default profile directories
    and will use dotbot's built-in Link plugin to create ``user.js`` symlinks
    in each profile directory that contains a ``prefs.js`` file.
